<p><strong>Mozilla teams up with Princeton University researchers to enable crowdsourced science for public good; collaborates with research groups at Princeton, Stanford on upcoming studies.</strong></p>



<p>Your data is valuable. But for too long, online services have pilfered, swapped, and exploited your data without your awareness. Privacy violations and filter bubbles are all consequences of a surveillance data economy. But what if, instead of companies taking your data without giving you a say, you could select who gets access to your data and put it to work for public good?</p>



<p>Today, we’re announcing <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">the Mozilla Rally platform</a>. Built for the browser with privacy and transparency at its core, Rally puts users in control of their data and empowers them to contribute their browsing data to crowdfund projects for a better Internet and a better society. At Mozilla, we’re working on building a better internet, one that puts people first, respects their privacy and gives them power over their online experience. We’ve been a leader in privacy features that help you control your data by blocking trackers. But, being “data-empowered” also requires the ability to choose who you want to access your data. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><em>“Cutting people out of decisions about their data is an inequity that harms individuals, society and the internet. We believe that you should determine who benefits from your data. We are data optimists and want to change the way the data economy works for both people and day-to-day business</em>. <em>We are excited to see how Rally can help understand some of the biggest problems of the internet and make it better.”</em></p><cite>Rebecca Weiss, Rally Project Lead</cite></blockquote>



<p>As a first step on this journey, we’re launching the new Rally research initiative, a crowdsourced scientific effort we developed in collaboration with <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/citp-people/jonathan-mayer/">professor Jonathan Mayer</a>’s research group at Princeton University. Computer scientists, social scientists and other researchers will be able to launch groundbreaking studies about the web and invite you to participate. A core focus of the initiative is enabling unprecedented studies that hold major online services accountable.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Online services constantly experiment on users, to maximize engagement and profit. But for too long, academic researchers have been stymied when trying to experiment on online services. Rally flips the script and enables a new ecosystem of technology policy research.”</em></p><cite>Jonathan Mayer, Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy</cite></blockquote>



<p>We’re kickstarting the Mozilla Rally research initiative with our first two research collaborator studies. Our first study is <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/current-studies/political-and-covid-19-news/index.html">“Political and COVID-19 News”</a> and comes from the Princeton team that helped us develop the Rally research initiative. This study examines how people engage with news and misinformation about politics and COVID-19 across online services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon, we’ll also be launching our second academic study, “Beyond the Paywall”, a study, in partnership with <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/shoshana-vasserman">Shoshana Vasserman</a> and<a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/gregory-j-martin"> Greg Martin</a> of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. It aims to better understand news consumption, what people value in news and the economics that could build a more sustainable ecosystem for newspapers in the online marketplace.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;We need research to get answers to the hard questions that we face as a society in the information age. But for that research to be credible and reliable, it needs to be transparent, considered and treat every participant with respect. It sounds simple but this takes a lot of work. It needs a standard bearer to make it the expectation in social science. In working with Rally, we hope to be part of that transformation.&#8221;</em></p><cite>Shoshana Vasserman, Assistant Professor of Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business</cite></blockquote>



<p>We are also launching a new toolkit today, WebScience, that enables researchers to build standardized browser-based studies on Rally. WebScience also encourages data minimization, which is central to how Rally will respect people who choose to participate in studies. WebScience was developed and open sourced by Jonathan Mayer’s team at Princeton and is now co-maintained with Mozilla.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">Rally</a>, we’ve built an innovative, consent-driven data sharing platform that puts power back into the hands of people. By leveraging the scale of web browsers &#8211; a piece of software used by billions of people around the world &#8211; Rally has the potential to help address societal problems we could not solve before. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a case for an equitable market for data, one where every party is treated fairly, and we welcome mission-aligned organizations that want to join us on this journey. </p>



<p><a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">Rally</a> is currently available for Firefox desktop users over age 19 in the United States. We plan to launch <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">Rally</a> for other web browsers and in other countries in the future. </p>



<p>To participate in Rally, join us at <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">rally.mozilla.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p><strong>Interested in joining Rally and want to know how it works?</strong></p>



<p>When you join <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/">Rally</a>, you have the opportunity to participate in data crowdsourcing projects — we call them “studies” — focused on understanding and finding solutions for social problems caused by the data economy. You will always see a simple explanation of a study’s purpose, the data it collects, how the data will be used, and who will have access to your data. All your data is stored in Mozilla’s restricted servers, and access to the analysis environment is tightly controlled. For those who really want to dig deep, you can read our<a href="https://rally.mozilla.org/how-rally-works/"> detailed disclosures</a> and even<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-rally"> inspect our code</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One year ago, we made <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/first-steps-toward-lasting-change/">a set of commitments</a> to make diversity and inclusion more than a catchphrase or hot button topic. We decided to roll up our sleeves and get busy establishing significant goals, putting resources behind them and making sure that everyone, including our company leadership, was taking action to create a more diverse and equitable place at Mozilla and in society.</p>



<p>We have taken steps to address the issue of anti-Black racism and the lack of diversity and inclusion in our company, and hopefully, in society, through programming and people initiatives.&nbsp; We have seen a significant increase in participation in diversity and inclusion initiatives, and perhaps, equally important, in our engagement survey results and in particular the increased scores on diversity and inclusion questions by people of color and women. While we have made strides on many of the goals established on June 18, 2020, we recognize this progress is the “<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/first-steps-toward-lasting-change/">First Step Toward Lasting Change</a>.”&nbsp; We continue to be committed through our actions and resources to improve Mozilla as a place to work for people of color and the internet for all.</p>



<h1><strong>1. Who we are: Our employee base and our communities</strong></h1>



<p>In our upcoming diversity and inclusion disclosure, you will find that we have greatly invested in improving diversity and enhancing a culture of inclusion at Mozilla. Through a balance of fun, education, celebration and conversations, we created safe spaces for people of color to share the totality of their human experience, honoring the beauty and joy of their lives and holding space to contend with the more sobering and harsh realities of race in society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hosted three&nbsp; panel discussions that each covered pertinent and insightful topics as designed by our Mozilla Resource Groups. There were the ones that gave us belly laughs &#8211; “What does it mean to lose your black card?” &#8211; and there were the ones that challenged us &#8211; “What is the impact of the model minority myth?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We held facilitated discussions designed to provide employees with an opportunity to engage in deep listening and sharing following an onslaught of racial violence across the U.S. These sessions, aptly named Gather @Mozilla, gave us an opportunity to collectively process some of the traumatic and triggering events happening around us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our goal was to provide various options for employees to connect and learn. Recognizing that learning is a personal experience, we offered paths for individual learning and collective learning. We published resource libraries (and shared them publicly: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Black_History_Month">Black History Month</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozAPI">Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month</a>), hosted virtual cooking lessons, convened talks with renowned authors, curated music playlists (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2FvNdVUchaFGAqml32YiQb?si=d5b604a1a39a405c">Latin and Hispanic Heritage Month</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77VohCbEw1yJ2tqe5CqoE4">Black History Month</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pG7ALsKpuuYl0ITl7DRcK?si=V2YaUAIJT_CPEoLOmKAPJw&amp;nd=1">Women’s History Month</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XdqhzA5nFxpT69Eo7x3oi">API Heritage Month Playlist</a>) and much more. By providing a breadth of opportunities to celebrate (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/yo-soy/">Latin and Hispanic Heritage Month celebration</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/celebrating-black-history-month/">Black History Month celebration</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/celebrating-women/">Women’s History Month celebration</a>, and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/asian-pacific-heritage-month-and-beyond/">Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month celebration</a>), we increased participation and invited our organization on a journey of co-creating an inclusive culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we round out the second half of 2021, we will be rolling out an Inclusion Champion program, working with DEI councils within each business group to promote organization-specific D&amp;I programming, deploying a D&amp;I skill development platform, and diversifying our talent acquisition pipeline.</p>



<h1><strong>2. What we build: Our outreach with our products</strong></h1>



<p>At Mozilla, we work to build a better internet and our products can help elevate the best of the internet. Through Pocket Collections, selections of stories curated by Pocket editors and guest editors, we introduced Collections that elevated diverse voices and gave insight into issues impacting BIPOC communities and the context around which they emerged (<a href="https://blog.getpocket.com/category/collections/racial-justice/">Racial Justice Collections</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com/collections/essential-reading-celebrating-juneteenth">Essential Reading: Celebrating Juneteenth</a>). We hoped to provide readers with content and perspectives they may not otherwise encounter.</p>



<p>We understood that when you point a finger at someone else, there is a finger pointing back at you. Thus, we launched a project that examined when and where <a href="https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2021/a-lifelong-journey">biases creep into user research and design</a> and initiated work efforts to reduce the amount of racist language in code (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642790">Remove all references to blacklist/whitelist within Gecko</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1645134">Remove references to slave</a>).</p>



<p>In the second half of 2021, our product teams will continue to identify opportunities to elevate diverse voices and combat unconscious biases in our products.</p>



<h1><strong>3. What we do beyond products: Our broader engagement with the world</strong></h1>



<p>We leveraged <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/speakers/virtual-dialogue-and-debates/">Dialogues &amp; Debates</a>, a speaker series, to address issues of A.I. and race and ethnicity and the challenges presented to communities of color because of this problem in tech and media. We had robust discussions about the use of technology to surveil historically vulnerable populations and used our network to call on fellow technology companies to be mindful of how they use technology in service to the criminal justice system instead of the communities of color we serve. The Mozilla Foundation launched campaigns calling on <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/nextdoor-pause-police-partnerships/">Nextdoor</a> and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/tell-amazon-ring-stop-sharing-information-police-services/">Amazon Ring</a> to pause their relationships with police departments and assess the impact of the platforms on users and communities of color. More than 28,000 people signed the petitions and several organizations partnered with Mozilla on escalation actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were able to have these critical community discussions and collaborations by being more thoughtful and intentional with the ways in which we used available funding from Mozilla Foundation in our commitment to social justice in tech and society. We granted 33% of Mozilla Foundation funds to black-led tech and social justice initiatives. Unfortunately, we fell short of our 40% target. While some may see this as a failure, we see it as an opportunity to acknowledge an area where we still need improvement and to commit to continuing to fund and elevate voices of color.</p>



<p>We also partnered with three Historically Black Colleges and Universities Engineering and Computer Science programs to promote the role of African Americans in tech, to engage in ethical computing discussions, and to cultivate relationships with aspiring scientists, designers and tech leaders so they understand there is a place for them in this industry.</p>



<p>Over the coming year, we are looking forward to deepening our relationships with institutions that serve and support communities of color and communities that have been historically marginalized. The <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/first-steps-toward-lasting-change/">First Step Toward Lasting Change</a> squarely moves us along the journey of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging but is not the middle nor final step. There remains significant room for improvement and we are committed to continue the course in closing the gaps that exist in tech and society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>On the internet you are never alone, and because of that at Mozilla we know that we can’t work to build a better internet alone. We believe in and rely on our community — from our volunteers, to our staff, to our users and even the parent’s of our staff (who also happen to be some of our power users). For Father’s Day, Mozilla&#8217;s Natalie Linden sat down with her father, big wave surf legend and surfboard maker, <a href="http://www.lindensurfboards.com/">Gary Linden</a> to talk the ocean, the internet and where humanity goes from here.</em></p>



<p><strong>We should probably start by telling people who we are. I am Natalie Linden, the Director of the Creative Studio in Mozilla marketing.</strong></p>



<p>And I’m Gary Linden. I’m your father. That’s probably my best accomplishment.</p>



<p><strong>Awww Dad.</strong></p>



<p>I make surfboards, run surfing events and surf. I’m semi-retired. Sort of.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-1024x683.jpg" alt="Gary Linden" class="wp-image-66432" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC8873-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>I don’t think you’re giving yourself enough credit. When I tell people I’m Gary Linden’s daughter, they always say “Gary Linden?! He’s a legend!”</strong></p>



<p>You know, if you’re involved in something for all your life, and you do a reasonably good job, you’ll get old and then you’ll be the oldest one around. So of course you’ll be the legend!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>One of the things you’re the oldest guy doing is paddling into really, really big waves.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Yeah I’m a big wave surfer, that’s been my passion. I wasn’t afraid of the ocean or of big waves, and that set me apart from most other surfers. So I got admission to a club that was pretty exclusive. And that was pretty cool. Then I started the Big Wave World Tour so younger surfers could have a career path to becoming a big wave rider. Big wave surfing takes more time and resources: you have to have the means to travel, the boards are more expensive. We weren’t seeing the younger people really be able to surf the big waves so we weren’t seeing what could be done in the peak athletic performance years. I’m pretty proud of that tour.</p>



<p><strong>One of the questions I was going to ask you is why you do what you do, and I think you’re starting to answer that. The way you’ve always described it to me is that from the first time you rode a wave on a surfboard, you knew that’s what you wanted to do, and you’ve oriented your whole life around being able to surf as much as possible.</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Even before I rode a surfboard, my father took me to the ocean and taught me to play in the waves, and about the currents, and body surfing. The freedom of it was like nothing else. I had asthma and hay fever, and when I was in the ocean I didn’t feel any of that. Whereas on land the pollens and the dryness just made being on the land kind of miserable. Like a fish out of water in a lot of ways. It was always rewarding for me to go into the ocean. It goes beyond just feeling good. It’s a state of mind as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-66442" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/DSC9061-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>So you started making surfboards, too.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I started making surfboards because surfing went into a transitional period — we all had longboards and then in the 70s, some of the Australians started experimenting with boards that were a foot shorter. There was nobody in San Diego making them, so I got a blank and shaped a board. And then I started making them for my friends, and it just set me on a path. But I’ve always made surfboards so that I could have the boards I needed to surf. If somebody else wanted one, that was fine, but I wasn’t making it for them. I was making it for me. Because surfing — not surfboard making — was my primary focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How has the internet changed what you do?</strong></p>



<p>Well first, the internet has made it incredibly easy to find out where the best waves of the day are. There are <a href="https://explore.org/livecams/hawaii/hawaii-pipeline-cam">cameras</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_e-kzztGIU">all</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lru-0DbrHHU">over</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCwLFGu5Ybc">the</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-oMVmNoPA">world</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBj-U5c-DAY">now</a> and you get surf reports. You don’t have to drive to the beach — you can live inland and plan ahead. And this year with the pandemic, live surfing competition was pretty much shut down. So a friend and I created a virtual surfing world tour called <a href="https://www.surfwebseries.com/">Surf Web Series</a>, where we could take video clips of surfers who had gone out the prior year, take a little video of their best waves and then we’d put those in heats just like a regular event and judge them and take it all the way to a final like a surfing competition. That was a lot of fun because it filled the gaps for a lot of the kids who are surfing professionally but they couldn’t give anything back to their sponsors during the pandemic because they weren’t competing, they didn’t have a way to get exposure, they didn’t have a way to further their career. This gave them an opportunity to keep going in their career, and keep the world interested in the sport of surfing. It’s opened up another avenue for the sport.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-background is-style-solid-color" style="background-color:#2dcb38"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-black-color"><p>I just focus on being in the best shape I possibly can, so I can surf. And I’m going to do it as long as I can. And when I can’t stand up anymore, I’ll be on a belly board. And when I can’t do that, I’ll jump in the waves.</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:70px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>One of the things I really admire about you, dad, is that you never stop having ideas. You set this intention of surfing for your life, and you keep finding new ways at it. You’re 71 and you’re still growing, you’re still changing, you’re still figuring out how to use the latest tools and culture to do the thing you set out to do. It inspires me every single day. It also helps that I see it up close, because we share an office!</strong></p>



<p>Well you inspire me too, because of your energy and motivation. I don’t think you’re ever going to stop either, because you are inspired, you are motivated. That’s what surfing was for me: it gave me something to focus on 100%. I love it so much, and it’s so good for me, that I don’t go snowboarding, I don’t skateboard, I don’t play football, I don’t ride bicycles. I don’t want to get hurt doing anything else. I don’t drink, or stay out at night. I just focus on being in the best shape I possibly can, so I can surf. And I’m going to do it as long as I can. And when I can’t stand up anymore, I’ll be on a belly board. And when I can’t do that, I’ll jump in the waves. I don’t really care. I just like that original feeling of going in the ocean with my dad and feeling clean and involved with the earth. My connection with the earth is the ocean.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of staying in shape, how has your relationship with the internet changed since the pandemic?</strong></p>



<p>You know the answer to this one, since we share a yoga room at our office. I started yoga about three years ago now because I wanted to be in better shape for surfing. I didn’t want to go at first because everyone was so young and as a beginner, it was intimidating. I couldn’t really keep up and felt awkward. But I found a geriatric yoga class, and it was really fun. I was getting better. Then with the pandemic, they started a zoom class. And now it’s actually even better. Because for older people, it’s still really intimidating. Now we can focus on the teacher and not feel self-conscious. It’s pretty awesome. Now you can do your work on the internet too — all the meetings and stuff. I mean, sometimes I wish the internet wasn’t there because you have to focus a lot more to stay grounded on the earth. Otherwise you’re just in that cloud. And that’s a really all-consuming place to be. I don’t think we were really made for that. So it’s another area where you have to find your balance. But you gotta find your balance in everything anyway. Even pigeon pose!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is there something about technology that blows your mind?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it doesn’t ever stop. It’s like watching science fiction happen in real life. It goes so fast. I’m fortunate enough that I was born before television, so I’ve seen a lot of stuff change. It’s so rapid. If you go back in history and think about evolution, it took so long for us not to be covered in hair, and to be able to talk, and now we’re talking about having chips in our bodies to help us heal, and artificial intelligence. If you dwell on it, it’s really overwhelming for someone my age. It can be scary. But there’s a lot of positive to it, so you’ve gotta stay on that side.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of positivity, what’s your favorite fun stuff to do online?</strong></p>



<p>I like Facebook and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP_e-OFnN6K/">Instagram</a> because I get to have some kind of contact with people all over the world. I’ve got friends everywhere from my life of traveling, and when I post something, the person who comments could be someone I haven’t talked to for 50 years! I like going on <a href="https://www.surfline.com/">Surfline</a> to see the surf report. And I like to write and receive emails. Because it used to be such a lag! I used to write letters to my friends, and it would be a month between receipt. And you’d change in that month. But with email, you can keep the conversation going without interruption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-background is-style-solid-color" style="background-color:#2dcb38"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-black-color"><p>&#8230;it took so long for us not to be covered in hair, and to be able to talk, and now we’re talking about having chips in our bodies to help us heal, and artificial intelligence.

<div style="height:70px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>What’s your hope for how technology can change or improve the future? What do you want [your grandson] Nimo to be able to do?</strong></p>



<p>I would like my grandson to be able to use the internet to feed and shelter the world. I don’t know how it’ll work, but you can already see… GoFundMe has helped the lives of a lot of my friends who got to my age or older, and just didn’t put anything away. Everybody throws a hundred bucks in, and all the sudden the guy’s at least got a chance to make it to hospice. That’s the kind of thing I hope we can do, that the communication will help us realize that it’s not just one person or one country versus another. It’s our world, and we have to all live together. I hope we get to the point that we see it’s a global economy, a global outcome. That we have to live as humans and not Americans or Chinese or Russians. I just think being able to communicate and see that we’re all the same, we all have the same needs. Food, shelter, companionship. If you get all that, you don’t really need anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>That’s exactly why I work at Mozilla: I believe our collective future will be decided on the internet. So we need to make sure it’s a place that can breed a positive outcome.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That’s right. And that’s the scary part we saw in the last election. All the junk that was online! So many lies! We didn’t know what was true, and what wasn’t true, and we had to decide for ourselves. We had to create our own filters. We had to choose the truth we wanted, the one that reflected the future of the world we want.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You’re my hero, Dad. Happy Father’s Day.</strong></p>

<p>Real talk: this web stuff can get confusing. And it’s really important that we all understand how it works, so we can be as informed and empowered as possible. Let’s start by breaking down the differences between the internet, browsers, search engines and websites. Lots of us get these four things confused with each other and use them interchangeably, though they are different. In this case, the old “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway">information superhighway</a>” analogy comes in handy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-66463" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2017/10/moz_explains_internet-browser-search_blog_header_1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Let’s start by breaking down the differences between internet, search engine, and browser. Lots of us get these three things confused with each other.</p>



<p>In this case, the old “internet superhighway” analogy comes in handy.</p>



<h3>The <b>internet</b></h3>



<p>The internet is the superhighway’s system of roads, bridges and tunnels. It is the technical network and infrastructure that connect all the computers and devices that are online together across the world. Being connected to the internet means devices, and whoever is using them, can communicate with each other and share information.</p>



<h3><b>Browser</b>s</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/what-is-a-browser/">The browser</a> is the car that gets you everywhere. You type a destination into the address bar and zoooom: your browser takes you anywhere on the internet. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/?utm_source=blog.mozilla.org&amp;utm_campaign=firefox_frontier&amp;utm_medium=referral">Firefox</a> is a browser — one built specifically for people, not profit.</p>



<h3><b>Search engine</b>s</h3>



<p>Search engines like Yahoo, Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo are the compass and the map. You tell a search engine an idea of where you want to go by typing your search terms, and it gives you some possible destinations. Search engines are websites, and they can also be apps. More on apps later.</p>



<h3><b>Websites and the web</b></h3>



<p>Effectively, you drive along the internet highway, stopping at whatever towns, stores and roadside attractions catch your fancy, aka websites. Websites are the specific destinations you visit throughout the internet. This is the content — the webpages, websites, documents, social media, news, videos, images and so on that you view and experience via the internet. The “web” (which is short for “world wide web”, hence “www”) is the collection of all these websites.</p>



<h3>Apps</h3>



<p>Any program that you download and install on your device is an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/mozilla-explains/no-judgment-digital-definitions-app-vs-web-app/">app</a>. Browsers are apps. Some websites — like Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and The New York Times, for example — double up as apps, so you get the same or similar content on the app as you would on the corresponding website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key thing to remember about apps, especially social media apps, is that while they are accessed via a connection to the internet (the infrastructure), content on them does not represent the full web. It’s just a slice. In addition, not everything published in an app is necessarily publicly accessible on the web.&nbsp;<br>The web is the largest software platform ever, a great equalizer that works on any device, anywhere. By design, the web is open for anyone to participate in. Read more about <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla’s mission</a> to keep the internet open and accessible to all.</p>

<p>Mozilla has always been about community and understanding that the internet is a better place when we work together. Ten years ago, Mozilla created <a href="https://community.mozilla.org/en/groups/mozilla-reps/">the Reps program</a> to add structure to our regional programs, further building off of our open source foundation. Over the last decade, the program has helped activate local communities in over 50 countries, tested Mozilla products and launches before they were released to the public, and collaborated on some of our biggest projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last decade also has seen big shifts in technology, and it has only made us at Mozilla more thankful for our volunteers and more secure in our belief that community and collaboration are key to making a better internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the threats to a healthy internet persist, our network of collaborative communities and contributors continues to provide an essential role in helping us make it better,” said Mitchell Baker, CEO and Chairwoman of Mozilla. “These passionate Mozillians give up their time to educate, empower and mobilize others to support Mozilla’s mission and expand the impact of the open source ecosystem – a critical part of making the internet more accessible and better than how they found it.”</p>



<p>Ahead of our 10 year anniversary virtual celebration for the Reps Mozilla program, or ReMo for short, we connected with six of the 205 current reps to talk about their favorite parts of the internet, why community is so important, and where the Reps program can go from here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Please introduce yourself! What community do you represent and how long have you been in the Mozilla Reps program?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ioana Chiorean:</strong> I am the Reps Module Owner at this time. I am part of Mozilla Romania, but have always been involved in technical communities directly, like QA, Firefox OS and support. My latest roles have been more on the advocacy side as Tech Speaker and building the Reps community. I’ve been in the Reps program since 2011.</p>



<p><strong>Irvin Chen:</strong> I&#8217;m a Mozilla Rep from Taipei, Taiwan. I&#8217;m representing the <a href="http://moztw.org">Mozilla Taiwan Community</a>, one of the oldest Mozilla communities.</p>



<p><strong>Lidya Christina:</strong> I’m a Mozilla Reps from Jakarta, Indonesia. I&#8217;ve been involved in the Reps program for more than two years now. I am also part of the review and resources team, provide operational support for the Mozilla community space in Jakarta, and a translator for the Mozilla localization project.</p>



<p><strong>Michael Kohler:</strong> I have been part of the Reps program since 2012, and I am currently a Reps Peer helping out with strategy-related topics within the Reps program. After organizing events and building the community in Switzerland, I moved to Berlin in 2018 and started to help there. In the past 13 years I have worked on different Mozilla products such as Firefox, Firefox OS and Common Voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu Khanna: </strong>I’m Pranshu Khanna, a Reps Council Member for the current term and a Rep from Mozilla Gujarat. I started my journey as a Firefox Student Ambassador from an event in January 2016, where my first contribution was to introduce the world of Open Source to over 150 college students. Since then, I’ve spoken to thousands of people about privacy, open web and open source to people across the world and have been a part of hundreds of events, programs and initiatives. </p>



<p><strong>Robert Sayles: </strong>Currently, I reside in Dallas, Texas, and I represent the North American community. I first joined the Mozilla Reps program in 2012, focusing mainly on my volunteer contribution to the Mozilla Festival Volunteer Coordinator 2013.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p></p>



<h3><strong>What part of the internet do you get the most joy from?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Irvin: </strong>For me, the most exciting thing about the internet is that no matter who you are or where you are located, you can always find and make some friends on the internet. For example, apart from each other, we could still collaborate online and successfully host the release party of Firefox in early 2000. Mozilla gives us, the local community contributors, the opportunity to participate, contribute and learn from each other on a global scale.</p>



<p><strong>Michael</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkgTxQm9DWM)">Nyan Cat </a>is probably the part of the internet that I get most joy from. Kidding aside, for me the best part of the internet is probably the possibility to learn new astonishing facts about things I otherwise would never have looked up. All the knowledge is a few clicks away.</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu</strong>: The most joyful moments from the internet have always come from being connected to people. It was 2006, and the ability to be on chat boards on a dial-up modem on 256Kbps to connect with people about anything, and scraping people on Orkut (remember that?). It’s been a ride, and now I speak to my mother everyday through FaceTime who is thousands of miles away and to my colleagues across the world. I would have been a kid in a small town in India who would not have imagined a world this big without the internet. It helped me embrace the idea of open knowledge and learn so much.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/moz_reps10_headshot_irvinchen_1200x800_210610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-66350" width="847" height="562"/></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Why did you join the Mozilla family?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Lidya</strong>: I started in 2016, when I attended an offline localization event at the Mozilla community space in Jakarta for the first time. I have continued to be involved in localization (L10N) events since then, and I also joined the Mozilla Indonesia community to help manage events and the community space in Jakarta.</p>



<p>What makes me really engage with the community is that I appreciate that it is a supportive environment where the opportunities to learn (locally and globally) are wide.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Michael:</strong> When I was in high school one of my teachers was a Firefox contributor. At some point he showed us what he is working on and that got me hooked into Mozilla. Already back then I had a big interest in open source, however it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me to contribute until that moment. I was mostly impressed by the kindness and willingness to help volunteers to contribute to Mozilla&#8217;s mission and products. I didn&#8217;t have much in-person contact with the community for the first three years, but the more I got to know many more Mozillians all around the world, the more I felt like I belonged in this community. I have found friends from all over the world due to my involvement with Mozilla!</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu:</strong> Roots. Mozilla has its roots in activism since the time the internet was born, and my connection with the Mozilla manifesto was instant. I realized that it wasn’t just marketing fluff since this is a community built with passion like the company is, from a small community of developers working to build not just a browser, but user’s freedom of choice. Mozilla’s community is important to how it started and where it’s being taken, and — if you’re committed to be a part of the journey — shape the future of the internet. I have been a part of protesting <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/?s=Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> for user privacy, building India’s National Privacy Law, mentor Open Source Leaders, and much much more. I’m so grateful for being a part of this family that genuinely wants to help people fall in love with what they are doing.</p>

<p></p>



<h3><strong>What is your favorite Mozilla product or Firefox project, and why?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Lidya:</strong> Beside the browser, my top favorite project/product are Pontoon (localization tool) and <a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor</a> to get notified if my account was part of a data breach or not.</p>



<p><strong>Michael:</strong> My favorite Mozilla product got to be <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>. I&#8217;ve been a Firefox user for a long time and since 2008 I&#8217;ve been using Firefox Nightly (appropriately called &#8220;Minefield&#8221; back then). Since then I have been an avid advocate for Firefox and suggested Firefox to everyone who wasn&#8217;t already using Firefox. Thanks to Firefox my software engineering knowledge grew over time and up to this day has helped me in my career. And all that of course apart from being the window to the online world!</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu:</strong> I love <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/">Common Voice</a>! If I could use emojis, this would be filled with hearts. Common Voice is such a noble project to help people around the world give a voice. The beauty of the project is how it democratizes locales and gives people across all demographics a voice in the binary technological world.</p>



<p><strong>Robert:</strong> I enjoyed working with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVdN3gH9d64">Firefox Flicks</a> many moons ago; as a Mozilla Rep, I had the privilege of interacting with the many talented creators and exploring how they were able to express themselves; I thought it was fantastic.   </p>

<h3><strong>Mozilla uses the term &#8220;community&#8221; quite a bit, and it means different things to different people – what does the Mozilla community mean to you?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ioana:</strong> For me, it literally means the people. Especially those that dedicate their free time to help others, to volunteer. It is the place I grew up as a professional and learned so much about different cultures worldwide.</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu: </strong>The Mozilla community is my family. I&#8217;ve met so many people across the world who passionately believe in the open web. This is a very different ecosystem than what the world considers a community, we are really close to each other. After all, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/11/26/the-monument-to-mozillians-is-coming-to-san-francisco/">doing good is a part of all of our code.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Robert: </strong>Mozilla community means everyone brings something different to the table; I have witnessed a powerful movement over the years. When everyone gets together and brings their knowledge to the table, we can make a difference in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/moz_reps10_headshot_robertsayles_1200x800_210610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-66390" width="834" height="553"/></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>How has the ReMo program evolved over the past decade, and where do you think the program is headed?</strong></h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong>Irvin:</strong> The Reps program had played an important role in connecting the isolated local communities. With regular meetups and events, we can meet with each other, receive regular updates from various projects, and collaborate on different efforts. As a community with years of history, we can extend our help beyond local users to foreign Mozillians by sharing our experience, such as experiences on community building, planning events, setting up the local website&#8230;etc. </p>



<p><strong>Michael:</strong> In the past years Reps continued to provide important knowledge about their regions, such as organizing bug hunting events to test local websites to make sure they work for <a href="https://community.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/firefox-quantum-sprint/">Firefox Quantum</a>. There would have been quite a few bugs without the volunteers testing local websites that Mozilla employees wouldn&#8217;t have been able to test themselves. Additionally, Reps have always been great at coordinating communities and helping out with conflicts in the community.</p>



<p>I see a bright future for the Reps program. Mozilla can do so much more with the help of volunteers. Mozilla Reps is the perfect program to help coordinate, find and grow communities to advance Mozilla&#8217;s vision and mission over the coming years to come.</p>



<p><strong>Pranshu</strong>: In the last decade the ReMo program has evolved from helping people to read, write and build on the internet to making the ecosystem better through creating leaders and helping users focus on their privacy. The program is headed to create pillars in the society that are committed to catalyse collaboration amongst diverse communities together for the common good, destroying silos that divide people. ReMo has Reps across the world, and I can imagine the community building great things together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a previous post, I <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/the-future-of-ads-and-privacy/">wrote</a> about a new set of technologies “Privacy Preserving Advertising”, which are intended to allow for advertising without compromising privacy. This post discusses one of those proposals&#8211;<a href="https://wicg.github.io/floc/">Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)</a>&#8211;which Chrome is currently <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox/floc">testing</a>. The idea behind FLoC is to make it possible to target ads based on the interests of users without revealing their browsing history to advertisers. We have conducted <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/ppa-docs/floc_report.pdf">a detailed analysis of FLoC privacy</a>. This post provides a summary of our findings.</p>



<p>In the current web, trackers (and hence advertisers) associate a <em>cookie</em> with each user. Whenever a user visits a website that has an embedded tracker, the tracker gets the cookie and can thus build up a list of the sites that a user visits. Advertisers can use the information gained from tracking browsing history to target ads that are potentially relevant to a given user’s interests. The obvious problem here is that it involves advertisers learning everywhere you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FLoC replaces this cookie with a new “cohort” identifier which represents not a single user but a group of users with similar interests. Advertisers can then build a list of the sites that all the users in a cohort visit, but not the history of any individual user. If the interests of users in a cohort are truly similar, this cohort identifier can be used for ad targeting. Google has run <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox/floc">an experiment</a> with FLoC; from that they’ve stated that FLoC provides <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">95% of the per-dollar conversion rate</a> when compared to interest-based ad targeting using tracking cookies.</p>



<p>Our analysis shows several privacy issues that we believe need to be addressed:</p>



<h3>Cohort IDs can be used for tracking</h3>



<p>Although any given cohort is going to be relatively large (the exact size is still under discussion, but these groups will probably consist of thousands of users), that doesn’t mean that they cannot be used for tracking. Because only a few thousand people will share a given cohort ID, if trackers have any significant amount of additional information, they can narrow down the set of users very quickly. There are a number of possible ways this could happen:</p>



<h4>Browser Fingerprinting</h4>



<p>Not all browsers are the same. For instance, some people use Chrome and some use Firefox; some people are on Windows and others are on Mac; some people speak English and others speak French. Each piece of user-specific variation can be used to distinguish between users. When combined with a FLoC cohort that only has a few thousand users, a relatively small amount of information is required to identify an individual person or at least narrow the FLoC cohort down to a few people. Let&#8217;s give an example using some numbers that are plausible. Imagine you have a fingerprinting technique which divides people up into about 8000 groups (each group here is somewhat bigger than a ZIP code). This isn’t enough to identify people individually, but if it’s combined with FLoC using cohort sizes of about 10000, then the number of people in each fingerprinting group/FLoC cohort pair is going to be very small, potentially as small as one. Though there might be larger groups that can&#8217;t be identified this way, that is not the same as having a system that is free from individual targeting.</p>



<h4>Multiple Visits</h4>



<p>People’s interests aren’t constant and neither are their FLoC IDs. Currently, FLoC IDs seem to be recomputed every week or so. This means that if a tracker is able to use other information to link up user visits over time, they can use the combination of FLoC IDs in week 1, week 2, etc. to distinguish individual users. This is a particular concern because it works even with modern anti-tracking mechanisms such as Firefox’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/">Total Cookie Protection</a> (TCP). TCP is intended to prevent trackers from correlating visits across sites but not multiple visits to one site. FLoC restores cross-site tracking even if users have TCP enabled.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>FLoC leaks more information than you want</h4>



<p>With cookie-based tracking, the amount of information a tracker gets is determined by the number of sites it is embedded on. Moreover, a site which wants to learn about user interests must itself participate in tracking the user across a large number of sites, work with some reasonably large tracker, or work with other trackers. Under a permissive cookie policy, this type of tracking is straightforward using third-party cookies and <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2014/08/07/the-hidden-perils-of-cookie-syncing/">cookie syncing</a>. However, when third-party cookies are blocked (or isolated by site in TCP) it’s much more difficult for trackers to collect and share information about a user’s interests across sites.</p>



<p>FLoC undermines these more restrictive cookie policies: because FLoC IDs are the same across all sites, they become a shared key to which trackers can associate data from external sources. For example, it’s possible for a tracker with a significant amount of first-party interest data to operate a service which just answers questions about the interests of a given FLoC ID. E.g., “Do people who have this cohort ID like cars?”. All a site needs to do is call the FLoC APIs to get the cohort ID and then use it to look up information in the service. In addition, the ID can be combined with fingerprinting data to ask “Do people who live in France, have Macs, run Firefox, and have this ID like cars?” The end result here is that any site will be able to learn a lot about you with far less effort than they would need to expend today.</p>



<h3>FLoC’s countermeasures are insufficient</h3>



<p>Google has proposed several mechanisms to address these issues.</p>



<p>First, sites have the option of whether or not to participate in FLoC. In the current experiment that Chrome is conducting, sites are included in the FLoC computation if they do ads-type stuff, either “load ads-related resources” or call the FLoC APIs. It’s not clear what the eventual inclusion criteria are, but it seems likely that any site which includes advertising will be included in the computation by default. Sites can also opt-out of FLoC entirely using the Permissions-Policy HTTP header but it seems likely that many sites will not do so.</p>



<p>Second, Google itself will suppress FLoC cohorts which it thinks are too closely correlated with “sensitive” topics. Google provides the details in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=Y2hyb21pdW0ub3JnfGRldnxneDo1Mzg4MjYzOWI2MzU2NDgw">this whitepaper</a>, but the basic idea is that they will look to see if the users in a given cohort are significantly more likely to visit a set of sites associated with sensitive categories, and if so they will just return an empty cohort ID for that cohort. Similarly, they say they will remove sites which they think are sensitive from the FLoC computation. These defenses seem like they are going to be very difficult to execute in practice for several reasons: (1) the list of <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en">sensitive categories</a> may be incomplete or people may not agree on what categories are sensitive, (2) there may be other sites which correlate to sensitive sites but are not themselves sensitive, and (3) clever trackers may be able to learn sensitive information despite these controls. For instance: it might be the case that English-speaking users with FLoC ID X are no more likely to visit sensitive site type A, but French-speaking users are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these mitigations seem useful, they seem to mostly be improvements at the margins, and don’t address the basic issues described above, which we believe require further study by the community.</p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>FLoC is premised on a compelling idea: enable ad targeting without exposing users to risk. But the current design has a number of privacy properties that could create significant risks if it were to be widely deployed in its current form. It is possible that these properties can be fixed or mitigated &#8212; we suggest a number of potential avenues&nbsp;in <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/ppa-docs/floc_report.pdf">our analysis</a> &#8212; further work on FLoC should be focused on addressing these issues.</p>

<p>Sometimes the hardest thing to write is the first word. It means you’re committed. No looking back now. You can’t leave that lone word just sitting there. Better add a second word, then a third. Now you’re on your way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Procrastination can be a major blocker for writers. While putting everything off until the last minute may work for a few thrill seekers out there, for most of us it means the work suffers with little time to reflect on early drafts or an opportunity to improve your phrasing and flow. If you’re looking for help on writing projects, here are some great browser extensions for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_content=writing-addons&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">Firefox</a> that are perfectly suited for writers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Focus first</strong></h3>



<p><em>I’ll get started on my paper after a quick detour on Twitter and my newsfeed…</em> you said to yourself two hours ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/?utm_content=writing-addons&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">LeechBlock NG</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/block-website/?utm_content=writing-addons&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">Block Site</a> have many of the same core functions that effectively allow you to block specific websites entirely, or for certain designated periods, so you can’t even be tempted to turn your attention to clickbait.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they each have a few distinct features, too. LeechBlock NG has all sorts of highly customizable ways to restrict yourself—from blocking just portions of certain sites (e.g. you can’t access the YouTube homepage but you can see specific videos) to setting limits on specific days (e.g. no Facebook Monday through Friday) to 60-second delayed access to some websites to stave off instant gratification and make sure you’re not about to make a horrible time-sucking mistake! Block Site has a nice custom redirection feature, so you’re taken to more productive websites whenever you try to visit one of your online weakspots; you can also leave yourself custom messages whenever you try to stray (<em>Get back to work, buddy, you can do it!</em>)</p>



<p>What if your writing project involves online research, so you can’t avoid potentially troublesome news or other information sites? <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tranquility-1/?utm_content=writing-addons&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">Tranquility Reader</a> removes everything but a web page’s words. Gone are distracting ads, images, tempting links to other stories—everything but the words you want to focus on.</p>

It automatically finds misspellings and awkward phrasing and suggests helpful corrections; it even spots common forehead-slapping mix-ups like <em>you’re/your</em> and <em>there/their</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Time management&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tomato-clock/?utm_content=writing-addons&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">Tomato Clock</a> is a simple but effective tool that helps break up your work sessions into focused “tomato” intervals inspired by <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works/">the Pomodoro technique</a>. Let’s say you prefer to write in 45-minute chunks before taking a break. The Tomato Clock extension lets you set your preferred work intervals and break times, and uses Firefox’s built-in notification system to alert you when time is up.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/?utm_content=firefox-tips&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog.mozilla.org">Firefox</a>, getting around the internet is fast, straight-forward and easy. Now you can go beyond the basics with these secret and not-so-secret tricks that make your internetting experience even more fun. Read on for some of our favorite Firefox features that you may not know about&#8230; yet.</p>



<h2>1. Send tabs across the room</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever been reading an article, recipe or website on your phone and thought it would look better and bigger on your computer, what do you do? Email or text yourself the link, right? Friends, there is a better way to do this with Firefox. Send that tab (or several tabs) to any device where you’re logged into your <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/">Firefox account</a>, and it’ll be waiting for you when you get there. It also works in reverse, so you can send a tab from your computer to your phone as well. Pick up where you left off with send tabs in Firefox.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1-1024x684.png" alt="" class="wp-image-66237" width="551" height="368" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1-1024x684.png 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1-768x513.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1-1000x668.png 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-1.png 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>



<ul><li>From Firefox on your computer: Right-click (PC) or two-finger tap (Mac) on a tab and select <strong>Send Tab to Device</strong>.</li><li>From Firefox on your phone: Tap the share icon, which will open up the <strong>Send to Device</strong> option.</li><li>Don’t see these options? Sign into your <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com">Firefox account</a> on both devices, then they’ll appear.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>2. Search for a needle in a tabstack</h2>



<p>Tab hoarders, we see you. Heck, we <em>are </em>you. Don’t ever let anyone shame you for having dozens (and dozens<sup>3</sup>) of open tabs, implying you don’t have it together and can’t find the right one. Instead, dazzle them with this trick. <strong>Add a % sign</strong> to your URL search bar to search specifically through all your open tabs, including tabs in different windows. Then you can click over to the already open tab instead of creating a duplicate, not that anyone has ever done that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bonus tip: </strong>If you love that tab search trick, try searching through your Bookmarks with * or your History with ^.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. Screenshots made simple</h2>



<p>Ever need a screenshot, but don’t remember how to do it? Or you snapped one successfully but lost it in the bowels of your hard drive? The built-in Firefox screenshot feature takes all the stress away. Right-click (PC) or two-finger tap (Mac) to call up the Firefox action menu (see above tip) and scroll to <strong>Take Screenshot</strong>. Bam, you’re screenshotting!&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus-1024x729.png" alt="" class="wp-image-65750" width="550" height="392" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus-1024x729.png 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus-300x213.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus-768x546.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus-1000x712.png 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/05/new-context-menus.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>4. Reopen a closed tab</h2>



<p>Tabs are life, and life is in tabs. Closing the wrong one leads to that sinking <em>oh no</em> feeling we know all too well. So we made a fix for that.</p>



<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Type <strong>Ctrl + shift + T</strong> for PC. <strong>Command + shift + T</strong> for Mac. Boom, tab instantly resurrected. You can even do that multiple times to reopen multiple closed tabs.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>5. Pocket the best for later</h2>



<p>There is so much good stuff to read and watch online that you’re not going to finish the internet in your lifetime. But, you can save the best for later. Click the Pocket icon to save any article, video or page straight from Firefox. Then, when you’ve got some extra time on your hands, it’ll be waiting in the Pocket app (available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-save-read-grow/id309601447">iOS</a>) on your phone. How brilliant is that?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-66247" width="515" height="296" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-2.png 658w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-2-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Where to get it: </strong>Look for the Pocket symbol to the right of your toolbar to get started saving any article, video or page from Firefox.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>6. Video multitasking with picture-in-picture</h2>



<p>Got things to do and games to watch? One of our most popular features, picture-in-picture, lets you pop out a video from Firefox so that it plays over the other windows on your screen. It’s perfect for <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-picture-in-picture-for-videos/">watching things on the side</a> — sports, hearings, live news, soothing scenes and, even cute animals. Plus, it has multi-mode.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="474" height="238" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-66277" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-5.png 474w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-5-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Where to get it:</strong> Hover over any playing video and look for the picture-in-picture icon.&nbsp;Try it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Peaceful forest from Firefox" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r45aZe_OtuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>7. Sample any color with the built-in eyedropper&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This one is for the creators out there. The web is a colorful place, and every color has a code called a HEX value assigned to it. With the eyedropper tool built into Firefox, you can go around the web quickly sampling colors and copying the HEX value to use elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZOmIspKPgc1B5dxT0CHJLsQxYOlZYMTBEQ1ga1rgefnwMIqioZdVNuLhkpv2E7dBLSWRoefN3ID3t-tmVf5N8ZOw6pjfgqIuYb_VWrEhNBXO_4wEzoEMfdKWAZfTzsjhHuk582vI" width="307" height="237"></p>



<p><strong>How to use it: </strong>Click the main menu in the upper right corner, scroll to <strong>More Tools</strong> and then to the eyedropper. Have fun sampling!</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>8. Fuggedaboutit!</h2>



<p>There might be times when you want to erase your recent browsing history super fast, and when that time comes, Firefox is here for you with the forget feature. Instead of asking a lot of complex technical questions, forget asks you only one: how much do you want to forget? Once you tell Firefox you want to forget the last 5 minutes, or 2 hours or 24 hours, it takes care of the rest. This is extra handy if you share a computer with friends or family. Or if you forgot to open a private browsing window. Or if you just don’t want your recent browsing history (<s>royal family gossip</s>) reappearing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="136" height="124" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/06/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-66267"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Where to get it:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Click the main menu in the upper right corner and select <strong>More Tools</strong>.</li><li>Next, select<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/customize-firefox-controls-buttons-and-toolbars"> <strong>Customize Toolbar</strong></a>.</li><li>Locate the Forget shortcut</li><li>Grab it with your mouse and drag it up to the Toolbar.</li><li>Then click the <strong>Done</strong> button.&nbsp;</li><li>Now the Forget button is at your fingertips everywhere you go in Firefox.</li></ul>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>9. Password headache fixer</h2>



<p>If you’ve heard it once, you’ve heard it a million times — <img loading="lazy" alt=":clap::skin-tone-4:" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/54LcG92vWvSLaGTERU9SGJpNlUmwd5TapT7zAMJO3olw_GjQr9xoTgd55IEibdt9m_BgYc_MunJV98lVNz-V-3gmjQ-LKzUUBUy8tvyECuUoBp0yW7rw7V4NEWNSpskteJAomjeh" width="24" height="24"> use <img loading="lazy" alt=":clap::skin-tone-4:" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/54LcG92vWvSLaGTERU9SGJpNlUmwd5TapT7zAMJO3olw_GjQr9xoTgd55IEibdt9m_BgYc_MunJV98lVNz-V-3gmjQ-LKzUUBUy8tvyECuUoBp0yW7rw7V4NEWNSpskteJAomjeh" width="24" height="24"> strong <img loading="lazy" alt=":clap::skin-tone-4:" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/54LcG92vWvSLaGTERU9SGJpNlUmwd5TapT7zAMJO3olw_GjQr9xoTgd55IEibdt9m_BgYc_MunJV98lVNz-V-3gmjQ-LKzUUBUy8tvyECuUoBp0yW7rw7V4NEWNSpskteJAomjeh" width="24" height="24"> unique <img loading="lazy" alt=":clap::skin-tone-4:" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/54LcG92vWvSLaGTERU9SGJpNlUmwd5TapT7zAMJO3olw_GjQr9xoTgd55IEibdt9m_BgYc_MunJV98lVNz-V-3gmjQ-LKzUUBUy8tvyECuUoBp0yW7rw7V4NEWNSpskteJAomjeh" width="24" height="24"> passwords. You might complain that it&#8217;s easier said than done, but in Firefox it’s actually so easy to do. With the built-in password generator, you can create and save strong unique passwords without ever leaving Firefox. No extra downloads, software or sketchy websites needed. Bonus tip: Sync your Firefox account between multiple devices to get your logins and passwords on your mobile.</p>



<p><strong>How to use it:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Right-click in the Password field and select <strong>Suggest Strong Password.</strong></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qsz3YKUIosSGFB8CjKkQwx_8D6KehoaRWaczDQUc8NSgl2fbcHDmTxxaDwZFaHNlnc7DN0cpY12SfcBRbevm8Ae1A8aYwlUNv37UQISSRhTRWwGWupjjN1TlFmHzdBFzrH4I3_k" width="320" height="264"></td><td><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5gelEywvj6n5J2Py5QprMHEQjs3dRSAE-XKtUG1leaGsqNiwK8x9ae8e9B8IeKSuKXEWimlkGMzaKPVtWBQEIdD2Kigm3pPjIkKA9lptnZG8LkeyHP9rhbEXeNRcypWKm48TBzZs" width="250" height="149"></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ul><li>To find saved passwords on your computer: Click the main menu in the upper right corner and select <strong>Passwords</strong>.</li><li>To find saved passwords on your phone, go to your Firefox settings and select <strong>Logins and Passwords</strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Bonus tip</strong>: Set up a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins#firefox:mac:fx89">Primary Password</a> to guard all those strong, unique passwords.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>10. Restore session</h2>



<p>Everyone has been through the struggle of restarting their computer or just the browser and losing tabs. It’s soul draining. By default, Firefox starts with a single open window. If you want to get back to where you left off, use the session restore feature that revives everything you had open last time. Tap the main menu in the upper right. Click <strong>History</strong>, then select <strong>Restore Previous Session</strong>. Soul restored.</p>



<p><strong>Make it permanent:</strong> You can set Firefox to always show the windows and tabs from your previous session each time you start Firefox. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-restore-my-tabs-last-time#w_restore-the-previous-session-every-time-you-open-firefox">Here’s how.</a></p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>11. The hidden menu</h2>



<p>Maybe you know about this one, but for those who do not, it’s essential. You need to know about the hidden Firefox action menu that appears and changes depending on where you open it. When you open the menu on a website, an image or the menu bar, the actions are contextual to what you’re doing at the moment. Smart! Fun fact: The top 25 context menu entries cover 97% of the things people want to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to use it: </strong>Right-click (PC) or two-finger tap (Mac) throughout Firefox.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When we set out earlier this year to reimagine <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/fresh-new-look-for-firefox/">Firefox for desktop</a> to be simpler, more modern and faster to use, we didn’t forget about your Apple mobile devices. We use our laptops and computers for work and play, but our tablets and phones sit a lot closer. They’re the first screens we see in the morning, and the last we see before we go to bed.</p>



<p>Firefox is only one of the many apps you use throughout the day, so our browser can’t just look good. It also needs to feel <em>at home</em>. The newest <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926">Firefox for iOS and iPadOS</a> represents what we think online life should be: fast, beautiful and private – presented in a package that looks and feels intuitive and natural.</p>



<h3>It’s fast</h3>



<p>You can already one-tap to go to your top sites, and we’ve brought the same speed to search. Every time Firefox or a new tab opens, the keyboard will now come up, ready for you to start searching right away.</p>



<p>When typing takes too long, you can build search suggestions word by word.</p>



<p>Firefox syncs your bookmarks, history, passwords and more between devices. But when you have many tabs open on your iPhone, iPad and computer, they’re often hard to find. Now you can simply start typing the tab’s name, and Firefox will show the tabs you have opened, no matter where they’re located.</p>



<p>And if you don’t quite know what something is called, you can browse for it easily. Open the main application menu, and all your bookmarks, history, downloads and reading list are there.</p>

<div style="height:59px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>It’s beautiful</h3>



<p>We’ve rebuilt parts of Firefox in native components, making it feel more iPhone and iPad-like than ever before. You’ll notice design elements that look and work identically to those found in many other apps, so our browser feels instantly familiar. We’ve also taken a major step up in accessibility. Firefox now supports more text sizes and integrates better with screen readers.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 forced the U.S. into a new era of telehealth. Therapists hope it’s here to stay.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>———</p>



<p>2020 was the worst year of Kali’s life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Going through something like the pandemic and not having family around, feeling out of control—I was on edge all year,” says the 30-year-old Colorado resident. And she wasn’t alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amid the COVID-19 lockdowns of early 2020, millions of Americans found themselves trapped at home with a backlog of unaddressed mental-health issues. As with so many other things, computer screens and video calls became the only portals out of lockdown—for work, entertainment and, ultimately, real psychological help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spring 2020, nearly all therapy was forced online, a shift that initially worried therapists and patients alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You do all these years of school to become a psychologist and all the training is in-person,” says Dr. Justin Puder, a therapist and licensed psychologist based in Boca Raton, Florida. “So when you transition to online, you have these doubts—will the connection be as genuine? Will it be as effective?”</p>



<p>But by summer, many therapists, including Puder, were experiencing an unprecedented surge in new-patient inquiries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About six months into the pandemic, I was over capacity, and that was the first time that my private practice had filled up like that,” Puder says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Puder’s clients were teens or young adults struggling with the transition to online school and the loss of important milestones like prom or graduation. Other therapists, like Dr. Jeff Rocker in Miami, Florida, saw an influx of Black men seeking therapy after a summer of highly publicized shootings of unarmed Black males at the hands of police. Others still, like K. Michelle Johnson, a sex and relationship coach and therapist based in Denver, Colorado, saw their practices flooded with struggling couples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the pandemic created a bit of a pressure cooker for people who were suddenly unable to avoid or escape the issues they’d been having,” Johnson says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Johnson’s clients, the shift to virtual therapy had both pros and cons. One issue was privacy. Virtual therapy nearly always takes place on specialized HIPAA-compliant platforms that ensure a secure connection, but interruptions from nosy roommates, curious children and needy pets are facts of life at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Jennifer Dunkle, a Certified Gottman Couples Therapist who specializes in financial coaching and is based in Fort Collins, Colorado, says many of the parents she works with still prefer online therapy—it freed them to get the help they needed without having to find or pay for childcare, she says.</p>



<p>That new therapy-from-anywhere paradigm has also helped improve access for people in more rural settings. Angela, 31, raises pigs and vegetables with her partner on a farm in southern Colorado. They live about 60 miles from the nearest mental health center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that commute, “Going into therapy could be a three-hour ordeal,” Angela says. “So virtual—I’m all about it.” </p>

<p>Virtual therapy also just <em>feels</em> more accessible for some patients.&nbsp;<br><br>Haley, a 26-year-old in Atlanta, Georgia, says the idea of having to meet a therapist face-to-face had always intimidated her. That was compounded by anxiety around having to locate a new office, find parking and be somewhere on time. Conversely, just opening up a laptop from the comfort of her kitchen or bedroom? “That felt so much easier,” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Puder suspects that there’s another phenomenon at play in the public’s newfound openness to virtual therapy: social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Puder currently has 335,000 followers on his <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amoderntherapist?lang=en">TikTok</a>. Rocker, better known in Miami as the <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/celebrity-therapist-jeff-rocker-on-black-men-dealing-with-anxiety-and-depression-amid-covid-19/">“Celebrity Therapist”</a> for his work with elite athletes and entertainers, has over 62,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/askjeff/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. Both are part of a new wave of influencer-therapists who build their followings through bite-size mental health tips, often infused with humor and a lot of personality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trend has been enormously effective, Rocker says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are seeing that there are so many different approaches and ethnicities and cultures within the mental health space,” Rocker says. “People are seeing that they can receive mental health services from people who look like them and talk like them and who they can relate to.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Puder also suspects that TikTok’s rise in popularity during the pandemic has helped cultivate a new light-hearted, open, stigma-free approach to mental health, which has in turn encouraged more people to give therapy a try. After all, the difference between watching weekly videos from your favorite therapist and signing up for weekly video chats is an easy leap to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better yet: According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618517304474?via%3Dihub">2018 analysis</a> of 64 different trials, internet-delivered therapy is just as effective as face-to-face therapy. And for some patients, it could be even more effective. Johnson reports that when clients can talk to her from a serene setting like a park, they’re able to open up and be more vulnerable than they may have been in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With virtual therapy, there’s that little bit of separation between me and the client,” she says. “Sometimes that helps them let their guard down a little more.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kali had been going to therapy for years to help her manage her anxiety and depression. Pre-pandemic, she says she never would have considered virtual therapy. But between the political and social unrest and general pandemic anxiety, she found herself making the switch from weekly in-person sessions to weekly online sessions — something she said was “absolutely” critical to her surviving 2020.<br><br>“I genuinely have no idea what I would have done without it,” she says. “I don’t know that I would have made it through this year.”</p>



<p>While she looks forward to going back to in-person sessions, Kali says her opinions of virtual therapy have changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do feel like that deep connection can still be felt,” she says, “Now when I’m away on a trip, I’m more inclined to keep therapy on the schedule.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Johnson doesn’t expect virtual therapy to ever completely replace in-person therapy. After all, in-person sessions are still a better fit for some clients, like those who may be starting deep trauma work, she says. Rocker adds that kids and teens often have trouble focusing on a screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But one thing is certain: Virtual therapy is here to stay, and the events of 2020 have pushed the mental health conversation in America into a new era—one Puder expects to snowball as more people continue to try therapy and talk about it online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you have the opportunity to be vulnerable and talk about a low you’re in, it’s freeing,” he says. “And I think when people get a taste of that, they’ll continue the conversation.”&nbsp;</p>
