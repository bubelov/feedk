---------------------

The first step is to find the app's
[_Application ID_](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
This is usually the same as the app's _Package Name_. You will find it
in files called _AndroidManifest.xml_ or _build.gradle_ most of the
time. You can also see it in the URLs for the app's page in various
app stores. Write it here:

#### APPLICATION ID: com.vishnuraghav.EnRecipes

Below is a template "metadata file" to fill out, it has only the
required fields.  F-Droid uses this file to build and publish the app.
[Build Metadata Reference](https://f-droid.org/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference)
documents all available options. Add values after the colon


```yaml
# Categories (one per line, each starting with a space and a minus), chosen from the

### Summary:
DTC Bus Tracker is displaying public transit information like distance, routes, stops, timings, etc related to DTC Buses in a user-friendly UI
### Description:
DTC Bus Tracker is a server and client app that displays information like distance, routes, stops, timings, etc related to DTC Buses in a user-friendly UI based on Android which is backboned by our servers based on Java SpringBoot and database management by PostgreSQL.

Our server manages the real large and heavy raw data coming right from the Delhi Government containing information about buses. The server performs various tasks like parsing raw data to Java objects which can further be used to create a database, finding ways to travel within different bus stops, finding the most optimal route, etc. After these tasks, the last thing a server can do is creating APIs.
- When a user launches the app, the app will check for location services and request the user location to get the bus stops near his/her location.
-  When a user launches the app, it also checks for the server whether it is online or offline and it notifies that the server is offline.
-  On launch, the app also checks for the Wi-Fi or data services are turned on so that the app is ready to request data from the server.
-  After launch, the app displays a map and search box to search the routes available between a source and destination stop.
-  After the search, the results are displayed in a bottom sheet in which the user can further see the route plotting on the map for each bus.
-  User can mark some stops as favorites or most visited so that he/she doesn't need to type in the search.
- On clicking a particular stop on the map displays the list of buses that will pass through that stop in the upcoming time.</description>

---------------------

The first step is to find the app's
[_Application ID_](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
This is usually the same as the app's _Package Name_. You will find it
in files called _AndroidManifest.xml_ or _build.gradle_ most of the
time. You can also see it in the URLs for the app's page in various
app stores. Write it here:

#### APPLICATION ID: com.portscanner.superredstone

Below is a template "metadata file" to fill out, it has only the
required fields.  F-Droid uses this file to build and publish the app.
[Build Metadata Reference](https://f-droid.org/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference)
documents all available options. Add values after the colon
